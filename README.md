<h3> What is Github? </h3>
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Github has two major features relevant for code management:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Version Control: version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. This means developers can safely edit code in independant code environments and remerge their changes once complete. This is essential for large projects.</l1>
  <p>
  <li>Git: Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developerâ€™s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. Over 87% percent of developers use Git</li>
</ul>

<h3>This github contains code relevant to: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Laboratory research projects</li>
  <li>Laboratory Validation Data</li>
  <li>Any automation scripts</li>
  <li>Excel macro's used in everyday lab tasks</li>
  <li>Lab developed applications</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to access this githubs contents: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>data and code can be used from the <a href = "https://github.com/">web browser (github.com)</a> by logging in to your github account with access to the repository of interest</li>
  <li>To access and edit the files remotely on windows, I would recommend using <a href = "https://desktop.github.com/">github desktop</a> as it provides the most intuitive method to access code for windows users. A getting started guide can be found <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop">here</a></li>
  <li>Github can also be accessed and manipulated through the command line with <a href = "https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/982d69b23659d66c0ca6fb1384f94c97">git</a> recommended for linux users and those familiar with command line</li>
</ul>
